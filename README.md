## STUDY BUDDY

### What is Study Buddy?

STUDY BUDDY is a tool for lifelong learners. It is a simple task manager that helps you keep track of all the self-organised studying you do - all while looking cute to keep you motivated.

### What can Study Buddy do?

Study Buddy works in a hierarchical order based on the different skills you want to acquire or improve on.

In Study Buddy you first define the skill you want to work on, e.g. coding or cooking. As Study Buddy focusses mostly on organising structured learning resources,for each skill you can then define courses you want to work through. Courses are divided into lessons, that in turn can be further broken down into tasks.

By checking off lessons you finished working through, Study Buddy helps to keep track of your progress on a course.

The intention behind Study Bunny is to give passionate learners a space to organise and see progress on their studies. I believe that giving yourself a dedicated space for self-organised study, it helps you motivate yourself and really focus on your goals.
